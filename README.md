# Rust Practice
This is the repo I'm making while I follow along the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)

Earlier stuff isn't noted as much since I'm familiar with it from learning Python but as things get more specific to Rust, there are many more notes and "extra" work done to learn the concepts.

The sand_box folder was while following along a [Rust Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF34dRivLOw)
